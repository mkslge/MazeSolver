Maze Solver
Welcome to the Maze Solver project! This project demonstrates the functionality of three fundamental pathfinding algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's Algorithm, applied to solving mazes. This project was apart of my CMSC132 Classwork

Features:

Maze Visualization: Interactive graphical representation of mazes and solution paths.
Algorithm Demonstration: Visualize how DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's Algorithm work to solve mazes.
User Interface: Developed using Java Swing for a responsive and user-friendly experience.
Algorithm Comparison: Compare the efficiency and behavior of different algorithms in solving mazes.
